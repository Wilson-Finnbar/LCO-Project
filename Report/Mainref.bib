@article{Mackey,
	abstract = {{In this paper we compare the properties of three subsystems of Galactic globular clusters, which are defined according to metallicity and horizontal branch morphology. We specifically focus on cluster luminosities, structures, surface brightnesses and ellipticities. It is shown that the so-called `young' halo (YH) clusters, which are thought to have formed in external satellite galaxies, exhibit characteristics which are clearly distinct from those of the `old' halo (OH) and bulge/disc (BD) clusters, the majority of which are believed to be Galactic natives. The properties of the YH objects are, in many respects, similar to those of clusters belonging to a number of present-day satellite dwarf galaxies. The OH and BD populations have apparently been strongly modified by destructive tidal forces and shocks in the inner Galaxy. By comparing the properties of the three cluster subsystems, we estimate that the present population of native Galactic clusters may only represent approximately two-thirds of the original population. Several clusters with low surface brightnesses are observed to be highly flattened. We briefly speculate on the possibility that this ellipticity reflects the intrinsic flattening of dark matter mini-haloes in which these optically dim clusters might be embedded. Finally, we examine the distribution of clusters on the size (logRh) versus luminosity (MV) plane. Three objects are seen to fall well above the sharp upper envelope of the main distribution of clusters on the size--luminosity plane: ω Centauri, M54 and NGC 2419. All three of these objects have previously, and independently, been suggested to be the stripped cores of former dwarf galaxies. This suspicion is strengthened by the additional observation that the massive cluster G1 in M31 plus a number of the most luminous clusters in NGC 5128 also fall in the same region of the logRh versus MV plane. All of the latter objects have previously been suggested as the stripped cores of now defunct dwarf galaxies.}},

@article{blackholes,
	abstract = {{We analyse Gaia EDR3 and re-calibrated HST proper motion data from the core-collapsed and non-core-collapsed globular clusters NGC 6397 and NGC 3201, respectively, with the Bayesian mass-orbit modelling code MAMPOSSt-PM. We use Bayesian evidence and realistic mock data sets constructed with Agama to select between different mass models. In both clusters, the velocities are consistent with isotropy within the extent of our data. We robustly detect a dark central mass (DCM) of roughly \\$1000\\, \\rm M\_\\odot\\$ in both clusters. Our MAMPOSSt-PM fits strongly prefer an extended DCM in NGC 6397, while only presenting a mild preference for it in NGC 3201, with respective sizes of a roughly one and a few per cent of the cluster effective radius. We explore the astrophysics behind our results with the CMC Monte Carlo N-body code, whose snapshots best matching the phase space observations lead to similar values for the mass and size of the DCM. The internal kinematics are thus consistent with a population of hundreds of massive white dwarfs in NGC 6397, and roughly 100 segregated stellar-mass black holes in NGC 3201, as previously found with CMC. Such analyses confirm the accuracy of both mass-orbit modelling and Monte Carlo N-body techniques, which together provide more robust predictions on the DCM of globular clusters (core-collapsed or not). This opens possibilities to understand a vast range of interesting astrophysical phenomena in clusters, such as fast radio bursts, compact object mergers, and gravitational waves.}},

@article{3201fact,
	abstract = {We have used observations obtained as part of the Hubble Space Telescope/ACS Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters to construct global present-day mass functions for 17 globular clusters utilizing multi-mass King models to extrapolate from our observations to the global cluster behavior. The global present-day mass functions for these clusters are well matched by power laws from the turnoff, ≈0.8 M☉, to 0.2--0.3 M☉ on the lower main sequence. The slopes of those power-law fits, α, have been correlated with an extensive set of intrinsic and extrinsic cluster properties to investigate which parameters may influence the form of the present-day mass function. We do not confirm previous suggestions of correlations between α and either metallicity or Galactic location. However, we do find a strong statistical correlation with the related parameters central surface brightness, μV, and inferred central density, ρ0. The correlation is such that clusters with denser cores (stronger binding energy) tend to have steeper mass functions (a higher proportion of low-mass stars), suggesting that dynamical evolution due to external interactions may have played a key role in determining α. Thus, the present-day mass function may owe more to nurture than to nature. Detailed modeling of external dynamical effects is therefore a requisite for determining the initial mass function for Galactic globular clusters.},

@article{radius,
	abstract = {{The Galactic globular cluster (GC) NGC 3201 is the first Galactic GC observed to host dynamically confirmed stellar-mass black holes (BHs), containing two confirmed and one candidate BH. This result indicates that GCs can retain BHs, which has important implications for GC evolution. NGC 3201 has been observed as part of the MAVERIC survey of Galactic GCs. We use these data to confirm that there is no radio or X-ray detection of the three BHs, and present the first radio and X-ray limits on these sources. These limits indicate that any accretion present is at an extremely low rate and may be extremely inefficient. In particular, for the system ACS ID #21859, by assuming the system is tidally locked and any accretion is through the capture of the companion's winds, we constrain the radiative efficiency of any accretion to ≲ 1.5 × 10−5. We also combine the radio and X-ray source catalogues from the MAVERIC survey with the existing MUSE spectroscopic surveys and the HUGS catalogue of NGC 3201 to provide a catalogue of 42 multiwavelength sources in this cluster. We identify a new red straggler source with X-ray emission, and investigate the multiwavelength properties of the sub-subgiant population in the cluster.}},

@article{metal,
	abstract = {{A large, perhaps dominant fraction, of the Milky Way's halo is thought to be built up by the accretion of smaller galaxies and their globular cluster (GC) systems. Here, we examine the Milky Way's GC system to estimate the fraction of accreted versus in situ formed GCs. We first assemble a high-quality data base of ages and metallicities for 93 Milky Way GCs from literature deep colour--magnitude data. The age--metallicity relation for Milky Way's GCs reveals two distinct tracks -- one with near constant old age of ∼12.8 Gyr and the other branches to younger ages. We find that the latter young track is dominated by GCs associated with the Sagittarius and Canis Major dwarf galaxies. Despite being overly simplistic, its age--metallicity relation can be well represented by a simple closed box model with continuous star formation. The inferred chemical enrichment history is similar to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud, but is more enriched, at a given age, compared to the Small Magellanic Cloud.After excluding Sagittarius and Canis Major GCs, several young track GCs remain. Their horizontal branch morphologies are often red and hence classified as young halo objects; however, they do not tend to reveal extended horizontal branches (a possible signature of an accreted remnant nucleus). Retrograde orbit GCs (a key signature of accretion) are commonly found in the young track. We also examine GCs that lie close to the Fornax--Leo--Sculptor great circle defined by several satellite galaxies. We find that several GCs are consistent with the young track and we speculate that they may have been accreted along with their host dwarf galaxy, whose nucleus may survive as a GC. Finally, we suggest that 27--47 GCs (about 1/4 of the entire system), from six to eight dwarf galaxies, were accreted to build the Milky Way GC system we see today.}},
